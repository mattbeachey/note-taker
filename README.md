# note-taker

## Description 
A simple note taking app built on an express server deployed to Heroku. The user can save a not, view old notes, and delete notes. All data is stored in a single JSON database, with each note assigned a unique id number upon creation. 

## Live App

## Demonstration

## Usage 
This app is primarily for demonstration purposes, as there is no permanent storage if you use the launched version on Herokuâ€”once the Heroku server shuts down, when you reopen the app it will display the default notes in its stored json database file.
